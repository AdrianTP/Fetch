Fetch
=====

Fetch is a library for reading email an attachments, primarily using the POP and
IMAP protocols.

Fetch was part of a large project, Mortar, which is hosted on Google Code. It is
currently being migrated over to Github, as well as being updated to support
modern php features. While the project is in flux I encourage you to try it out,
but be careful about using it in a production environment without proper
testing.
